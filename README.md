Loom: https://www.loom.com/share/815df1505ee54e718eb7ce1b99270e36

I have cloned Strapi core, created a blog CMS, and exposed APIs.





# Strapi Blog Project

# 🚀 Strapi Blog CMS Project

This project is a **Strapi-based Headless CMS** built as part of a learning and onboarding task.  
It demonstrates how to create, run, and manage a backend CMS using Strapi.

## 📌 What is Strapi?

**Strapi** is an **open-source Headless Content Management System (CMS)** built using **Node.js**.  
It allows developers to create, manage, and deliver content through **REST or GraphQL APIs** instead of traditional web pages.

In simple words:  
> Strapi is a backend system that stores data and provides it to websites, mobile apps, or any software using APIs.

## 🧠 How Strapi Works

Strapi acts as a **content backend**.

1. Admin creates content using Strapi’s admin dashboard  
2. Strapi stores data in a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)  
3. Strapi exposes the data through REST or GraphQL APIs  
4. Frontend applications (React, mobile apps, etc.) fetch data using these APIs  

This makes Strapi **frontend independent**.

## ⚙️ How Strapi is Used

Strapi is used as a **backend CMS** in modern applications.

Typical workflow:
- Developers define content types (Blog, Users, Products, etc.)
- Admins manage content in Strapi UI
- Frontend applications fetch data using APIs
- Data updates automatically when content changes

Strapi removes the need to manually build:
- APIs  
- User management  
- Database connections  
- Media uploads  
- Permissions
